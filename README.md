# WSU-Spring-2023-Saltine-Hackaton

Flight simulator created in Unity with adjustable thrust and first person movement mechanics. 
Balloons spawn around the map when space is clicked and even though balloons are 2d sprites in a 3d engine, 
three different viewmodes (above, below, and centered) help give perspective in the plane.

# How to Run:
Precondition: Unity is installed
Doubleclick and run the saltine.exe file
Space will spawn balloons
W and S engage and disengage thrust
A and D tilt to the left and right
